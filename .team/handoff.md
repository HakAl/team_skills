## Summary (Previous Session: 2025-12-28)
- Shipped GitHub Pages site (hakal.github.io/team_skills)
- Added Code Review Protocol to TEAM.md
- Added Invocation Protocol (team = personas, not subagents)
- Added Handoff Protocol to TEAM.md
- Expanded Gary (UX Guru) and Gabe (Red Team)
- Created 4 security beads for zen-mode (P0-P2)
- Evaluated mcp_agent_mail and AutoGen - tabled both
- First community interaction - responded to GitHub issue on self-organization
- Identified suspicious axon repo (QuantumNiyam) - deleted

## Current Session (2026-01-01)
- Handoff context loaded successfully
- zen-mode security changes accepted and committed

## Decisions Made
- Team members are personas in same context, NOT Task subagents
- Static HTML > complex infrastructure for simple needs
- Per-project handoff files, not global
- Reba reviews all code, Matt for security-sensitive
- master is default branch (deleted stale skill_team)

## Open Threads
- [x] zen-mode scope-limited trust PR (zen-p9i) - COMPLETED
- [x] Safety Rail #4 updated - removed stale branch reference, preserved user oversight intent

## Next Session
Handoff system working. Awaiting user direction.
