## Current Session (2026-02-01)
**Theme: Housekeeping — dispatch processed, iterate cycle**

### Completed
- **Restored demo GIF** — `docs/demo.gif` lost in site ownership transfer (commit 424446d), recovered from git history
- **Processed QA dispatch** — repo health review, grade A-. Three findings: `nul` file, stale dirs, IMMUTABLE debt
- **Housekeeping resolved**:
  - `nul` added to `.gitignore` (Windows artifact)
  - `planning-peter/examples/` and `templates/` confirmed already deleted
  - IMMUTABLE restructure parked as known debt in TEAM.md
- **Replied to QA** — accepted validation suite offer. Scoped to structural checks (SKILL.md sections, resume/ dirs, orphan detection, IMMUTABLE checksums). Reba reviews when ready.
- **Iterate cycle** — trimmed handoff, updated TEAM.md current state, fixed stale Genesis header
