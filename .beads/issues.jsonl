{"id":"_skills-fcu","title":"Neo cold-critic agent: independent adversarial review during planning","description":"Neo can spawn a Task agent as a cold critic tool during planning, then interpret and report results in context. Neo decides when to use it — the critic judges when independence is needed, not the author (who is subject to self-preference bias on confident plans).\n\n## Research Basis\n\n### Strongly Supporting\n\n**Multiagent Debate Improves Reasoning (Du et al., ICML 2024)**\narxiv 2305.14325 — Multiple LLM instances debating improves both reasoning and factual accuracy. The foundational paper. Separate instances, not personas. Closest analog to cold-critic design.\n\n**Authorship Visibility Increases Self-Voting (2025)**\narxiv 2509.23537 — Multi-agent orchestration matches/exceeds strongest single model on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, MuSR. Critical finding: revealing authorship increased self-voting and tie outcomes. In current team setup, Neo sees Peter's reasoning chain (authorship visible). A cold agent does not. Strongest specific evidence that context isolation matters.\n\n**Hybrid Routing Is Optimal (2025)**\narxiv 2505.18286 — Route complex tasks to multi-agent, simple to single-agent. Matches our design: Neo judges when cold critique is warranted.\n\n**LLM Self-Preference Bias (2024)**\narxiv 2404.13076 — Models recognize their own output and rate it higher. Self-recognition correlates linearly with self-preference strength. When Neo critiques Peter in shared context, it is the same model evaluating its own output — the condition where self-preference activates.\n\n**Adversarial Critique Outperforms Neutral (2024)**\narxiv 2405.09935 — DEBATE framework: adversarial multi-agent critique outperforms single-agent by 6-12pp on NLG evaluation tasks. Devil's Advocate role essential. Diminishing returns after ~4 iterations.\n\n### Counterarguments (Acknowledged)\n\n**Multi-Persona Thinking May Match Multi-Agent (2025)**\narxiv 2601.15488 — Multi-persona (one model, multiple viewpoints — what we do now) achieves comparable or superior bias mitigation vs multi-agent debate with lower overhead. Argues unified context enables cross-perspective reasoning that isolation breaks. Mitigated in our design because Neo stays in context and interprets the cold critique — we get both isolation AND integration.\n\n**Lazy Agent Risk (2025)**\narxiv 2511.02303 — Agents in multi-agent setups can become lazy: contributing trivially, copying, not genuinely critiquing. Mitigated by Neo's interpretation layer — she filters shallow critique.\n\n**Cascading Failure Risk (2025)**\narxiv 2510.07593 — Multi-agent errors cascade. Bad cold critique could mislead Neo. Mitigated by Neo's in-context judgment — she can reject bad critique using context the agent lacked.\n\n## Architectural Impact\n\n| Factor | Shared Context (Current) | Cold Agent (Proposed) | Research Verdict |\n|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Bias | High. Neo influenced by Peter's reasoning chain | Low. Authorship hidden, critique objective | Strongly favors proposed (2509.23537) |\n| Reasoning | Integrated. Neo knows why Peter chose | Isolated. Critic judges only the what | Mixed (2601.15488 warns of context loss) |\n| Reliability | Echo chamber. Plausible errors slide through | Adversarial. Higher hallucination catch rate | Favors proposed (2305.14325) |\n| Efficiency | High. Single inference stream | Variable. Adds latency/cost | Neutral with hybrid routing |\n\n## Mechanism\n1. Peter plans (in context)\n2. Neo decides 'I need a cold read on this' — the critic judges when independence is needed\n3. Neo spawns a Task agent with plan text only (no reasoning chain, NO team persona identity)\n4. Cold critique returns\n5. Neo interprets in context — filters, adds nuance, rejects shallow/wrong critique\n6. Reports to Peter, discussion continues\n\n## Design Constraints\n- Cold critic agent must NOT be given a team persona identity (anonymous reviewer)\n- Neo decides when to spawn, not Peter (avoids self-preference bias in the trigger decision)\n- Used selectively for complex architectural plans, not universally\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Neo's skill file documents the cold-critic capability\n- At least one real plan tested with and without cold critique\n- Team can articulate when to use vs not\n- Rollback: Neo simply stops using it if critique quality degrades planning","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-29T05:34:13.6745041-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-29T06:21:57.9917054-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T06:21:57.9917054-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["enhancement","planning","research-backed"]}

Research shows that's exactly the condition where self-preference bias activates — and revealing authorship makes it worse.\n\n### Problem Statement\nLLM personas in shared context suffer self-preference bias when critiquing their own plans. The model recognizes its own output and rates it higher (arxiv 2404.13076). Revealing who authored content increases self-voting (arxiv 2509.23537). This means in-context 'devil's advocate' personas may be softer critics than they appear.\n\n### Research Landscape (7+ papers)\n\n**Supporting multi-agent critique:**\n- arxiv 2305.14325 (Du et al., ICML 2024) — Multiagent debate improves reasoning and factual accuracy. Foundational paper.\n- arxiv 2509.23537 (2025) — Multi-agent orchestration matches/exceeds strongest single model. Authorship visibility increases self-voting. Key mechanism for context isolation.\n- arxiv 2505.18286 (2025) — Hybrid routing optimal. Complex tasks benefit from multi-agent; simple ones don't. Don't use universally.\n- arxiv 2404.13076 (2024) — Self-preference bias. Self-recognition correlates linearly with self-preference strength.\n- arxiv 2405.09935 (2024) — DEBATE framework. Adversarial critique outperforms neutral by 6-12pp. Devil's Advocate role essential.\n\n**Counterarguments (must include for credibility):**\n- arxiv 2601.15488 (2025) — Multi-Persona Thinking achieves comparable bias mitigation in single context. Challenges whether isolation is needed.\n- arxiv 2511.02303 (2025) — Lazy agent risk. Multi-agent agents can contribute trivially rather than genuinely critique.\n- arxiv 2510.07593 (2025) — Multi-agent often fails to surpass strong single-agent baselines. Cascading failures.\n\n### Our Approach\nNeo (architect/critic persona) stays in context but spawns an anonymous cold critic agent with just the plan text. Neo interprets the cold critique using full context. This gets both isolation (for bias reduction) and integration (for nuanced judgment).\n\nKey design decisions:\n- Neo decides when to spawn (critic judges need for independence, not the author)\n- Cold agent has no team persona identity (anonymous reviewer)\n- Selective use — complex architectural plans only\n- Neo can reject shallow/wrong critique\n\n### Architectural Impact Table\n| Factor | Shared Context | Cold Agent | Research Verdict |\n|--------|---------------|------------|------------------|\n| Bias | High (authorship visible) | Low (authorship hidden) | Strongly favors cold agent |\n| Reasoning | Integrated (knows the why) | Isolated (judges only the what) | Mixed |\n| Reliability | Echo chamber risk | Adversarial catch rate | Favors cold agent |\n| Efficiency | Single stream | Added latency | Neutral with hybrid routing |\n\n### Results\n(To be filled after implementation and testing — do NOT publish without real data)\n\n## Key Points to Hit\n- This is quantified research, not vibes — cite specific papers and findings\n- The authorship-visibility finding (2509.23537) is the strongest hook\n- Include counterarguments honestly — the Multi-Persona paper challenges the premise\n- Our design addresses the counterarguments: Neo interprets in context (gets both isolation and integration)\n- The elegant part: context isolation is the feature, not the bug\n- No protocol changes needed — fits existing team rules\n- Practical example of research-informed agent architecture","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-29T05:34:32.1854597-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-29T05:58:28.7137271-05:00","labels":["blog","content","research"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"_skills-wx1","depends_on_id":"_skills-fcu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-29T05:34:32.1890854-05:00","created_by":"unknown"}]}
