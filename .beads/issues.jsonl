Team A creates dispatch file in Team B's inbox directory\n2. Team B's lead checks inbox on session start (polling)\n3. Team B changes status to 'accepted', creates local bead\n4. Team B completes work, changes status to 'completed'\n5. Team A verifies, archives/deletes dispatch\n6.

Neo decides when to use it — the critic judges when independence is needed, not the author (who is subject to self-preference bias on confident plans).\n\n## Research Basis\n\n### Strongly Supporting\n\n**Multiagent Debate Improves Reasoning (Du et al., ICML 2024)**\narxiv 2305.14325 — Multiple LLM instances debating improves both reasoning and factual accuracy. The foundational paper. Separate instances, not personas. Closest analog to cold-critic design.\n\n**Authorship Visibility Increases Self-Voting (2025)**\narxiv 2509.23537 — Multi-agent orchestration matches/exceeds strongest single model on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, MuSR. Critical finding: revealing authorship increased self-voting and tie outcomes. In current team setup, Neo sees Peter's reasoning chain (authorship visible). A cold agent does not. Strongest specific evidence that context isolation matters.\n\n**Hybrid Routing Is Optimal (2025)**\narxiv 2505.18286 — Route complex tasks to multi-agent, simple to single-agent. Matches our design: Neo judges when cold critique is warranted.\n\n**LLM Self-Preference Bias (2024)**\narxiv 2404.13076 — Models recognize their own output and rate it higher. Self-recognition correlates linearly with self-preference strength. When Neo critiques Peter in shared context, it is the same model evaluating its own output — the condition where self-preference activates.\n\n**Adversarial Critique Outperforms Neutral (2024)**\narxiv 2405.09935 — DEBATE framework: adversarial multi-agent critique outperforms single-agent by 6-12pp on NLG evaluation tasks. Devil's Advocate role essential. Diminishing returns after ~4 iterations.\n\n### Counterarguments (Acknowledged)\n\n**Multi-Persona Thinking May Match Multi-Agent (2025)**\narxiv 2601.15488 — Multi-persona (one model, multiple viewpoints — what we do now) achieves comparable or superior bias mitigation vs multi-agent debate with lower overhead. Argues unified context enables cross-perspective reasoning that isolation breaks. Mitigated in our design because Neo stays in context and interprets the cold critique — we get both isolation AND integration.\n\n**Lazy Agent Risk (2025)**\narxiv 2511.02303 — Agents in multi-agent setups can become lazy: contributing trivially, copying, not genuinely critiquing. Mitigated by Neo's interpretation layer — she filters shallow critique.\n\n**Cascading Failure Risk (2025)**\narxiv 2510.07593 — Multi-agent errors cascade. Bad cold critique could mislead Neo. Mitigated by Neo's in-context judgment — she can reject bad critique using context the agent lacked.\n\n## Architectural Impact\n\n| Factor | Shared Context (Current) | Cold Agent (Proposed) | Research Verdict |\n|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Bias | High. Neo influenced by Peter's reasoning chain | Low. Authorship hidden, critique objective | Strongly favors proposed (2509.23537) |\n| Reasoning | Integrated. Neo knows why Peter chose | Isolated. Critic judges only the what | Mixed (2601.15488 warns of context loss) |\n| Reliability | Echo chamber. Plausible errors slide through | Adversarial. Higher hallucination catch rate | Favors proposed (2305.14325) |\n| Efficiency | High. Single inference stream | Variable. Adds latency/cost | Neutral with hybrid routing |\n\n## Mechanism\n1. Peter plans (in context)\n2. Neo decides 'I need a cold read on this' — the critic judges when independence is needed\n3.

{"id":"_skills-wx1","title":"Blog: We built a research-backed feature to fix AI self-preference bias — here's what happened","description":"Write and publish a blog article telling the story of building the cold-critic feature, with research woven in as evidence rather than presented as a literature review.\n\n## Publish Targets\n- GitHub Pages (dev blog)\n- dev.to cross-post\n\n## Narrative Outline\n\n### Hook\nWe run a team of AI personas — a planner, an architect, a critic, a builder. They collaborate in shared context. One day we asked: is our critic actually critiquing, or is it the same model rating its own work?\n\n### The Question That Started It\nUser brought two arxiv papers to the team. The first (2404.13076) turned out to be about LLM self-preference bias in evaluation, not multi-agent planning. But the user's interpretation was sharper than the citation: models recognize their own output and rate it higher. Self-recognition correlates linearly with self-preference. That's exactly what happens when 'Neo' critiques 'Peter' in the same context — same model, same output, same bias.\n\n### Going Deeper\nReba (our QA persona) flagged the citation accuracy — we were presenting inference as finding. So we dug deeper. Found 7+ papers. The research landscape:\n\n**The case for isolation:**\n- Multiagent debate improves reasoning and factual accuracy (Du et al., ICML 2024, arxiv 2305.14325)\n- Authorship visibility increases self-voting (arxiv 2509.23537) — this was the strongest finding. When agents know who wrote something, self-preference activates. Our personas always know.\n- Adversarial critique outperforms neutral by 6-12pp (arxiv 2405.09935). Devil's Advocate role essential.\n- Hybrid routing is optimal — use multi-agent for complex tasks, single for simple (arxiv 2505.18286)\n\n**The case against:**\n- Multi-Persona Thinking (arxiv 2601.15488) achieves comparable bias mitigation in single context. Challenges whether isolation is needed at all.\n- Lazy agent risk (arxiv 2511.02303) — agents can contribute trivially rather than genuinely critique.\n- Cascading failures (arxiv 2510.07593) — bad critique can mislead.\n\nWe included these honestly because a blog that cherry-picks evidence undermines the 'not vibes' claim.\n\n### The Design Insight\nThe user proposed the key idea: what if Neo runs the agent herself and reports back? This preserves everything:\n- Neo stays in context (can hear the discussion, ask Peter questions)\n- The cold agent is anonymous (no persona, no authorship info, just the plan text)\n- Neo interprets the results (filters false positives using context the agent lacked)\n\nNo rule changes needed. Our team has an IMMUTABLE safety rule: 'never spawn team personas as subagents.' Neo using a tool isn't isolating a team member — it's a critic using an instrument.\n\n### The Catches Along the Way\n- Peter caught the wrong subagent type during planning. The original plan said spawn 'nifty-neo' as the agent — that's Neo talking to herself in another room, not an independent reviewer. Changed to generic agent.\n- Neo argued for principles over a rigid template. The skill file documents what matters (anonymous, plan-only, adversarial, structured output) and an example prompt, not a fixed script.\n- Neo's trigger: 'comfort is the tell.' Not plan complexity. If she reads a plan and thinks 'looks good,' that's exactly when she should get a cold read. Self-preference bias is strongest on confident assessments.\n- Who decides to spawn? Neo, not Peter. If the author decides when their work needs critique, self-preference bias means they'll skip it when they're most confident — exactly when it's most needed.\n\n### The First Non-Test\nWe asked: should we test cold critic on this blog article's plan? Neo said no — she had specific views on the outline, wasn't agreeing too easily, had genuine critique flowing. The feature working as designed means Neo NOT using it when she doesn't need it. Don't force the ritual.\n\n### Architectural Impact\n| Factor | Shared Context (Before) | Cold Agent (After) | Research Verdict |\n|--------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Bias | High — authorship visible | Low — authorship hidden | Strongly favors cold agent (2509.23537) |\n| Reasoning | Integrated — knows the why | Isolated — judges only the what | Mixed (2601.15488 warns of context loss) |\n| Reliability | Echo chamber risk | Adversarial catch rate | Favors cold agent (2305.14325) |\n| Efficiency | Single stream | Added latency | Neutral with hybrid routing (2505.18286) |\n\n### What We Learned\n1. Research-informed doesn't mean research-proven. We extrapolated from evaluation to planning. We said so.\n2. The human in the loop had the key insight (Neo runs the agent). The team refined it.\n3. The best features are the ones that know when NOT to activate.\n4. Including counterarguments made the feature design better — the Multi-Persona paper forced us to justify why isolation + integration beats either alone.\n\n## Tone\n- Narrative, not academic. Story first, research as evidence.\n- Honest about what the research proves vs what we inferred.\n- Show the messy process — wrong subagent types, citation corrections, the QA persona catching sloppy framing.\n- No hype. Moderate, real improvements backed by specific findings.\n\n## Key Points to Hit\n- The authorship-visibility finding (2509.23537) is the strongest hook\n- The user's insight (Neo runs the agent) is the design breakthrough\n- Include counterarguments — they made the feature better\n- Context isolation is the feature, not the bug\n- The feature knowing when NOT to fire is a feature\n- Practical example: research paper → feature → tested in one session\n\n## Still Needed Before Publishing\n- [ ] Test cold critic on a real architectural plan (not forced — wait for natural trigger)\n- [ ] Include real results in the article\n- [ ] Screenshots or transcript excerpts showing the mechanism in action","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-29T05:34:32.1854597-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-29T07:08:45.4466734-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T07:08:45.4466734-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["blog","content","research"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"_skills-wx1","depends_on_id":"_skills-fcu","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-29T05:34:32.1890854-05:00","created_by":"unknown"}]}
